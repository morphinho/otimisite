It's essentially free money.</li>\n<li><strong>Diversify across account types:</strong> Balance between tax-deferred accounts (401k, IRA) and taxable accounts provides flexibility in retirement.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider healthcare costs:</strong> Healthcare expenses often increase significantly in retirement. Factor these into your planning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each strategy addresses different aspects of retirement planning, creating a comprehensive approach that adapts to changing circumstances.</p>\n\n<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2><p>Common Mistakes to Avoid requires understanding both the theoretical foundations and practical applications.
